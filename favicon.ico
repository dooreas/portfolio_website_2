The favicon.ico file is typically a binary file that represents the icon displayed in the browser tab. Since I cannot generate binary files directly, you will need to create or obtain a suitable favicon image and save it as `favicon.ico` in the specified directory.

If you need a placeholder or a specific design for your favicon, you can use online favicon generators to create one from an image or design you have in mind. Once you have your favicon, save it in the `/personal-portfolio/personal-portfolio/public/` directory as `favicon.ico`.
